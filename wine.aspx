        <br />
        <p>
        Full and fruit intense aromas of ripe, dark cherries and cranberries explode from the glass with hints of lavender and English roses. The palate is generous and big, with the sweetness of strawberries, other mature fruits and savory toffee, which leads to a smoky long finish of oak and cedar.

        <span class="style1">Namaster Peace $12</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        Peace is a unique blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Gewürztraminer fermented to a semi-sweet style done exclusively in stainless-steel tanks. The 2008 Peace has ravishing peach scents coupled with floral overtones to tickle the nose with a rich aromatic style. Blending the acidity and sweetness of our Chardonnay with the spice and floral notes of our Gewürztraminer has balanced wine with rich fruit tastes. For those looking for a wine of great character and versatility, this is your wine.

        <span class="style1">Namaste Vineyards 2007 Gewürztraminer $12</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        The 2007 Gewürztraminer from Harmony Vineyard starts with a brilliant aromatic nose of apples and pear.  This off-dry style Gewürztraminer is refreshingly light on the palette. It has crisp vibrant fruit flavors and finishes beautifully with a nice lingering touch of sweetness.

        <br />
        <p>
        88% Tempranillo and 12% Monastrell with an intense ruby color.  Richness of red fruit aromas and floral nuances highlighted  by its freshness and acidity.  Well balanced with good structure and firm tannins which linger on the long finish.  Jean Leon was born in Spain but moved to Hollywood where he met James Dean and they opened “La Scala” together in Beverly Hills.  He has been making wine since 1963.

        <span class="style1">HV Cellars Pomegranate Wine $16</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        Full, ripe pomegranate, naturally fermented with just a hint of tartness        
        </p>   
        <span class="style1">HV Cellars Plum Wine $16</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        Ripe, rich, Oregon Santa Rosa plums fill this wine with summer goodness. Not too sweet, nor too tart, but just right. A long lasting spicy finish makes this wine a perfect match to Asian cuisine, or great on its own, chilled watching a beautiful sunset or just thinking of one.
        </p>   
        <span class="style1">HV Cellars Cranberry Wine $16</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        The best cranberries in the world are grown on the Oregon Coast. One look at a bottle, with its intense dark richness and you'll see we've selected the most flavorable berries for our Cranberry wine; just enough sweetness with a tart snap. A treat for all seasons, especially good during the holidays, but a real treat is having it with fresh Pacific Northwest salmon. We think of it as "a taste of the Oregon Coast."
        </p>   
        <span class="style1">HV Cellars Blackberry Wine $18</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        When you taste our Blackberry you'll think you're drinking a hand full of fresh berries.  One fan described it as Blackberry pie in a bottle.  We suggest you to try this wine with dark chocolate ~ but we cannot be held responsible for the subsequent addiction.
        </p>
        <span class="style1">HV Cellars Pinot Noir Southern Oregon 2008 $17.50</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        HV Cellars Pinot Noir is light to medium body with fresh fruit aromas, Raspberry and Cherry with hints of clove and cinnamon followed by a long smooth finish.
        </p>
        <span class="style1">Charamba "Douro" 2007 Aveleda  $8.50</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        Charamba is a ripe-tasting dry red wine that delivers an edge of firm, mineral-inflected austerity.  It is not a stand-alone wine. It needs food, preferably something hearty like a good, not-too-spicy chili or a good hamburger. Then the wine shines, with a wild cherry note and that mineral quality refreshing the palate, aided by a bright acidity. This is a wine of originality selling for a bargain price.
        </p>
        <span class="style1">St Innocent 2008 Willamette Valley, Villages Cuvee $23</span>
        <br />
        <p>
        The 2008 Villages Cuvée Pinot noir has a lovely nose of bright red fruit and sweet spices. Cherry and red berry flavors are layered with pie spices and a hint of flowers. Deep ruby and quite rich for Vitae Springs, the '08 reflects the vintage's more concentrated and robust, layered structure. Bottled in November '09, it will benefit from being opened 1-2 hours and can be aged up to 6 years to gain complexity. This is a beautiful bottle from one of the greatest Oregon vintages in the past 30 years.
