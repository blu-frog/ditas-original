            In 1986 Michele Chirgwin started making chocolates and candy in her own home. It wasn't long until she developed a full line of truffles, chocolates, fudge and sweet treats - all of which are still made in the Clackamas facility. Clusters, melts, crisps, chews, novelties and sugar-free, Michele's has them all.
