        Are you a registered 501(c)3 organization in the greater Sandy, Oregon area looking for fund raising opportunities? Let Dita’s Chocolates customize the perfect package for you. Many of our providers have a wonderful story to tell, as well as superb tasting chocolates to help you reach your goals. We especially recommend Equal Exchange, Madécasse and Dagoba for their support of fair trade and their desire to improve conditions in chocolate growing communities around the world. These chocolate bars are of superior quality and have a 
        wide selection of flavors. Additionally, we have novelty items such as critter truffles, holiday shaped chocolate pops, assorted chocolate gift boxes, and more that can easily be adapted to fund raising activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dita’s Chocolates will purchase product after presales are totaled. If you would like to personalize your product, Dita’s will purchase the packaging products or you can provide your own (must be preapproved by Dita’s 
        beforehand due to health code regulations).  Your organization will not be charged for any remaining Dita’s purchased chocolate items or packaging items after the event has ended provided all items are returned in resalable condition.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, organize your group and provide one point of contact to Dita’s Chocolates.  Select the items for presale, take orders, collect funds and notify purchasers their items will be available within 3 weeks.  
        Then, distribute <b>&quot;... a little bite of bliss&quot;</b> to all purchasers.  You retain 20% of the retail price for all products sold, however we do require a minimum of 50 units.<br />
        <br />
